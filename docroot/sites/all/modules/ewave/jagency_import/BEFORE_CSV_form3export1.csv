The Yeshiva's overall mission is to foster a love of God and a lifelong commitment to learning Torah, to Israel, and its people. To understand the spirit of this Yeshiva, a story must be told: Many years ago, the Baal HaTanya was learning in his room. In the next room, his grandson, the Tzemach Tzedek, was learning and in the third room a baby slept. Suddenly, the baby woke and began to cry. The Tzemach Tzedek continued studying. The Baal HaTanya got up, walked past the Tzemach Tzedek into the room with the baby. He picked up the baby and comforted it. When the baby was quiet, the Baal HaTanya said to his grandson"If you learn Torah and don’t hear a Jewish baby's cry, there is something wrong with your learning."In Yeshivat Har Etzion, our goal is to learn Torah AND hear the baby's cry.
